## Conceptuals
- Problems
    + (16-12-19) With current calculation methods the time of claculation 
			(time_quads + hist) is of the same order (but still higher ) than 
			acquisition. Its only going to get worst when adding multiple 
			numecrical filters.
- Questions
	+ (16-12-19) What cost the most in computation time in a 
			aquasition + time_quad (single of multi-kernels) + histograms ? 
			And what could potentially be reduced ?
- Ideas ?
    + (16-12-19) Using SIMD operations to speedup multi-kernels operations 
			on the same data vector ?
    + (16-12-19) Using CUDA for even faster FFTs (FFTWs) ?

## Workflow
- Git stuff

	 + Stop using git submodules 
    - Automate git commits (and push ?) before making actual measurments ?
    - Git doesn't distinguish between Caption.txt and caption.txt (it anoying)
- Python stuff
    - Redesign the Python directory ?
    - Learn pycharm ?
    - Learn spyder ?
- Notebook 
    - Use jupiter to summurized experiements (after or during experiement ?)
        + dont use jupyter but use markdown inside code ? and combine with markdown viewer inside notepad++
- Compiling stuff
    - Find a more intuitive, more flexible solution to replace gnu-make
- C++ 
    - Explicitly write down my directory/file conventions
- gvim 
    - look it up and test
- premake
    - A language to manage the generation of makefile
- markdown
    - Is there a for of mardown that would help to organize c++ text file and python text file ?

        + (16-12-19) Fixed : #pragma reduction makes copies of the reduction variable for each thread 
                            but when this variable is also a member attribute of the class and is called inside a function 
                            called by the child thread the member attribute will be called instead of the copy made for the thread. 
                            This can lead to race conditions in the code.
        + (16-01-20) This bug was supposed to be fixed but it wasn't now it should be fixed.

TASK_01 Adding bivariate case to SM-Moments_cumulants
- General bivariate moments implemented DONE(28-01-20)
- Only cumulant  c_ii c_jj c_iijj implemented DONE(28-01-20)

TASK_02 Adding first order moment and cumulant to 2D histograms
- Pybind11 wrapper working (see TASK_01) DONE(28-01-20)
- Validation/Moments_cumulants_2.py creatre
	- monovariate moments of 2D histograms were validated with scipy.stat.moment

## 10-02-20
- Only l_data, l_valid, l_full and bin depth of 1D histograms should be uint64_t other should be uint
- 

## 24-02-20
- Removed git submodule
- Added a feature to Histograms
	- Cap the number of thread depending on machine
- Make it so that TimeQuad object return only valid part to Python
	- Done and tested
- Prepare routine PQvsVDC_0
	- Aquiering  p and q using multiple filters
	- Accumulating the results in 2D Histogram leeping track of experimental parameters
	- Calculating cumulants from those
	- Display expval of n and n^2 from thos data

# Futur
- Checks if n_threads checks works properly for histogram class
	
# OPENNED BUGS 
- Pybind11 doesn't work with uint64_t 
	- This coul potentially cause problems with l_data, l_valid and l_full
